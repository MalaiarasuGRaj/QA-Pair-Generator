# QA Pair Generator 🧠🔍

## Overview 📚

Welcome to the **QA Pair Generator** project! This powerful tool uses cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) models to generate insightful question-answer pairs from PDF documents. Whether you're working with academic papers, business reports, or any other document type, our application makes it easy to extract and understand key information.

## Features ✨

- **PDF Upload**: Effortlessly upload your PDF files through an intuitive interface.
- **Text Extraction**: Extract text and images from PDFs with advanced OCR technology.
- **Question Generation**: Create relevant questions from extracted text using the Valhalla model.
- **Difficulty Classification**: Categorize questions into difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) with the RoBERTa model.
- **Answer Extraction**: Get precise answers to your questions based on the document context.
